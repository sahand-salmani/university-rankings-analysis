# University Rankings Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains an analysis of university rankings data, aiming to provide insights into the performance and regional disparities of higher education institutions worldwide. The analysis explores various factors influencing university rankings and visualizes the data to facilitate understanding and interpretation.

## Objectives
The main objectives of this analysis are as follows:

### Rankings Analysis:
- **Correlation between World Rank and National Rank**: Investigate the relationship between a university's world rank and its national rank, shedding light on its global standing within its respective country.
- **Regional Comparison of Scores**: Group universities by regions or countries and compare their average scores to reveal disparities in educational quality and research output across different parts of the world.
- **Top Universities by Criteria**: Identify top universities based on specific criteria such as quality of education, alumni employment, or research output to understand excellence in different aspects.

### Geographical Analysis:
- **Heatmap of University Locations**: Visualize the distribution of universities on a map to highlight clusters of high-ranking institutions in certain regions and identify areas with fewer top-tier institutions.
- **Regional Rank Distribution**: Plot histograms or box plots of university ranks for different regions to reveal regional disparities and factors influencing university performance in specific geographic areas.

### Correlation Analysis:
- **Correlation Matrix of Quality Metrics**: Compute a correlation matrix of quality metrics and overall scores to identify which metrics are most strongly correlated with university rankings.
- **Regression Analysis**: Perform regression analysis to quantify the impact of individual quality metrics on university scores and inform strategic decision-making by university administrators.

### Influence Analysis:
- **Influence vs. Ranking Scatter Plot**: Create a scatter plot comparing university influence with their rankings to identify influential universities driving knowledge dissemination and collaboration within the academic community.
- **Citation Network Analysis**: Construct a citation network among universities based on their research output and analyze network centrality measures to identify influential universities in the academic landscape.
