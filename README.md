# University Rankings Analysis Project

## Overview

This project aims to analyze university rankings data to gain insights into the performance of universities globally. By examining various geographical, rankings, correlation, and influence aspects, we seek to understand the factors influencing university performance and identify patterns and trends in the data.

## Objectives

### Geographical Analysis
1. **Regional Rank Distribution**:
   - Analyze the average ranks of universities across different regions to uncover regional disparities in rankings.
   
2. **University Count by Country in Top 1000 Rankings**:
   - Determine the number of universities each country has in the top 1000 ranking universities list to understand the global distribution of top universities.

3. **University Count by Continent in Top 1000 Rankings**:
   - Determine the number of universities each continent has in the top 1000 ranking universities list to understand the distribution of top universities across different continents.

4. **University-to-Population Ratio**:
   - Calculate the ratio of the number of universities in the top 1000 ranking list to the population of the country to assess the concentration of top universities relative to the population size of each country.

5. **University-to-GDP per Capita Ratio**:
   - Calculate the ratio of the number of universities in the top 1000 ranking list to the GDP per Capita of the country to assess the concentration of top universities relative to the economy of each country.

### Rankings Analysis
1. **Correlation between World Rank and National Rank**:
   - Use scatter plots and calculate Pearson correlation coefficient to understand the alignment between a university's world rank and its national rank.

2. **Regional Comparison of Scores**:
   - Group universities by regions or countries and compare their average scores to reveal disparities in educational quality and research output.

3. **Top Universities by Criteria**:
   - Identify the top universities based on specific criteria such as quality of education, alumni employment, or research output.

### Correlation Analysis
1. **Correlation Matrix of Quality Metrics**:
   - Compute a correlation matrix of quality metrics (education, faculty, research output, etc.) and overall scores. Visualize the matrix using a heatmap to identify which metrics are most strongly correlated with university rankings.

### Influence Analysis
1. **Influence vs. Ranking Scatter Plot**:
   - Create a scatter plot comparing university influence (measured by citations or other metrics) with their rankings. Identify outliers or universities with disproportionately high influence relative to their rankings, and investigate potential factors driving their influence within the academic community.
